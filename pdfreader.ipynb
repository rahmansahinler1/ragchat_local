concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems for remote biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement, of the use of AI systems for risk assessments of natural persons for the purpose of law enforcement and of the use of AI systems of biometric categorisation for the purpose of law enforcement, it is appropriate to base this Regulation, in so far as those specific rules are concerned, on Article 16 TFEU.', 'In light of those specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is appropriate to consult the European Data Protection Board.', '(4 AI is a fast evolving family of technologies that contributes to a wide array of economic, environmental and societal benefits across the entire spectrum of industries and social activities.', 'By improving prediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, and personalising digital solutions available for individuals and organisations, the use of AI can provide key competitive advantages to undertakings and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in healthcare, agriculture, food safety, education and training, media, sports, culture infrastructure management, energy, transport and logistics, public services, security, justice, resource and energy efficiency, environmental monitoring, the conservation and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems and climate change mitigation and adaptation.', '(5 At the same time, depending on the circumstances regarding its specific application, use, and level of technological development, AI may generate risks and cause harm to public interests and fundamental rights that are protected by Union law.', 'Such harm might be material or immaterial, including physical, psychological, societal or economic harm.', '(6 Given the major impact that AI can have on society and the need to build trust, it is vital for AI and its regulatory framework to be developed in accordance with Union values as enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Treaties and, pursuant to Article 6 TEU, the Charter.', 'As a prerequisite, AI should be a human centric technology.', 'It should serve as a tool for people, with the ultimate aim of increasing human well being.', '(7 In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public interests as regards health, safety and fundamental rights, common rules for high risk AI systems should be established.', 'Those rules should be consistent with the Charter, non discriminatory and in line with the Union’s international trade commitments.', 'They should also take into account the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade and the Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI of the High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG).', '(8 A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on AI is therefore needed to foster the development, use and uptake of AI in the internal market that at the same time meets a high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety and the protection of fundamental rights, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection as recognised and protected by Union law.', 'To achieve that objective, rules regulating the placing on the market, the putting into service and the use of certain AI systems should be laid down, thus ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market and allowing those systems to benefit from the principle of free movement of goods and services.', 'Those rules should be clear and robust in protecting fundamental rights supportive of new innovative solutions, enabling a European ecosystem of public and private actors creating AI systems in line with Union values and unlocking the potential of the digital transformation across all regions of the Union.', 'By laying down those rules as well as measures in support of innovation with a particular focus on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), including startups, this Regulation supports the objective of promoting the European human centric approach to AI and being a global

of the European Parliament and of the Council (15).', '(12 The notion of ‘AI system’ in this Regulation should be clearly defined and should be closely aligned with the work of international organisations working on AI to ensure legal certainty, facilitate international convergence and wide acceptance, while providing the flexibility to accommodate the rapid technological developments in this field.', 'Moreover, the definition should be based on key characteristics of AI systems that distinguish it from simpler traditional software systems or programming approaches and should not cover systems that are based on the rules defined solely by natural persons to automatically execute operations.', 'A key characteristic of AI systems is their capability to infer.', 'This capability to infer refers to the process of obtaining the outputs, such as predictions, content recommendations, or decisions, which can influence physical and virtual environments, and to a capability of AI systems to derive models or algorithms, or both, from inputs or data.', 'The techniques that enable inference while building an AI system include machine learning approaches that learn from data how to achieve certain objectives and logicand knowledge based approaches that infer from encoded knowledge or symbolic representation of the task to be solved.', 'The capacity of an AI system to infer transcends basic data processing by enabling learning reasoning or modelling.', 'The term ‘machine based’ refers to the fact that AI systems run on machines.', 'The reference to explicit or implicit objectives underscores that AI systems can operate according to explicit defined objectives or to implicit objectives.', 'The objectives of the AI system may be different from the intended purpose of the AI system in a specific context.', 'For the purposes of this Regulation, environments should be understood to be the contexts in which the AI systems operate, whereas outputs generated by the AI system reflect different functions performed by AI systems and include predictions, content, recommendations or decisions.', 'AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, meaning that they have some degree of independence of actions from human involvement and of capabilities to operate without human intervention.', 'The adaptiveness that an AI system could exhibit after deployment, refers to self learning capabilities, allowing the system to change while in use.', 'AI systems can be used on a stand alone basis or as a component of a product, irrespective of whether the system is physically integrated into the product (embedded) or serves the functionality of the product without being integrated therein (non embedded).', '(13 The notion of ‘deployer’ referred to in this Regulation should be interpreted as any natural or legal person, including a public authority, agency or other body, using an AI system under its authority, except where the AI system is used in the course of a personal non professional activity.', 'Depending on the type of AI system, the use of the system may affect persons other than the deployer.', '(14 The notion of ‘biometric data’ used in this Regulation should be interpreted in light of the notion of biometric data as defined in Article 4, point (14) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Article 3, point (18) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and Article 3, point (13) of Directive (EU) 2016/680.', 'Biometric data can allow for the authentication, identification or categorisation of natural persons and for the recognition of emotions of natural persons.', '(15 The notion of ‘biometric identification’ referred to in this Regulation should be defined as the automated recognition of physical, physiological and behavioural human features such as the face, eye movement, body shape, voice prosody, gait, posture, heart rate, blood pressure, odour, keystrokes characteristics, for the purpose of establishing an individual’s identity by comparing biometric data of that individual to stored biometric data of individuals in a reference database, irrespective of whether the individual has given its consent or not.', 'This excludes AI systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, whose sole purpose is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security access to premises.', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj', '(15 Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on a Single Market For Digital Services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (Digital Services Act) (OJ L 277, 27.10.2022, p.', '(16 The notion of ‘biometric categorisation’ referred to in this Regulation should be defined as assigning natural persons to specific categories on the basis of their biometric data.', 'Such specific categories can relate to aspects such as sex age, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, behavioural or personality traits, language, religion, membership of a national minority, sexual or political orientation.', 'This does not include biometric categorisation systems that are a purely ancillary feature intrinsically linked to another commercial service, meaning that the feature cannot, for objective technical reasons, be used without the principal service, and the integration of that feature or functionality is not a means to circumvent the applicability of the rules of this Regulation.', 'For example, filters categorising facial or body features used on online marketplaces could constitute such an ancillary feature as they can be used only in relation to the principal service which consists in selling a product by allowing the consumer to preview the display of the product on him or herself and help the consumer to make a purchase decision.', 'Filters used on online social network services which categorise facial or body features to allow users to add or modify pictures or videos could also be considered to be ancillary feature as such filter cannot be used without the principal service of the social network services consisting in the sharing of content online.', '(17 The notion of ‘remote biometric identification system’ referred to in this Regulation should be defined functionally as an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons without their active involvement, typically at a distance, through the comparison of a person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, irrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used.', 'Such remote biometric identification systems are typically used to perceive multiple persons or their behaviour simultaneously in order to facilitate significantly the identification of natural persons without their active involvement.', 'This excludes AI systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, the sole purpose of which is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security access to premises.', 'That exclusion is justified by the fact that such systems are likely to have a minor impact on fundamental rights of natural persons compared to the remote biometric identification systems which may be used for the processing of the biometric data of a large number of persons without their active involvement.', 'In the case of ‘real time’ systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all instantaneously, near instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay.', 'In this regard, there should be no scope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real time’ use of the AI systems concerned by providing for minor delays.', '‘Real time’ systems involve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near live’ material, such as video footage, generated by a camera or other device with similar functionality.', 'In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast, the biometric data has already been captured and the comparison and identification occur only after a significant delay.', 'This involves material, such as pictures or video footage generated by closed circuit television cameras or private devices, which has been generated before the use of the system in respect of the natural persons concerned.', '(18 The notion of ‘emotion recognition system’ referred to in this Regulation should be defined as an AI system for the purpose of identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data.', 'The notion refers to emotions or intentions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, embarrassment excitement, shame, contempt, satisfaction and amusement.', 'It does not include physical states, such as pain or fatigue, including, for example, systems used in detecting the state of fatigue of professional pilots or drivers for the purpose of preventing accidents.', 'This does also not include the mere detection of readily apparent expressions gestures or movements, unless they are used for identifying or inferring emotions.', 'Those expressions can be basic facial expressions, such as a frown or a smile, or gestures such as the movement of hands, arms or head, or characteristics of a person’s voice, such as a raised voice or whispering.', '(19 For the purposes of this Regulation the notion of ‘publicly accessible space’ should be understood as referring to any physical space that is accessible to an undetermined number of natural persons, and irrespective of whether the space in question is privately or publicly owned, irrespective of the activity for which the space may be used, such as for commerce, for example, shops, restaurants, cafés; for services, for example, banks, professional activities hospitality; for sport, for example, swimming pools, gyms, stadiums; for transport, for example, bus, metro and railway stations, airports, means of transport; for entertainment, for example, cinemas, theatres, museums, concert and conference halls; or for leisure or otherwise, for example, public roads and squares, parks, forests, playgrounds.', 'A space should also be classified as being publicly accessible if, regardless of potential capacity or security restrictions, access is subject to certain predetermined conditions which can be fulfilled by an undetermined number of persons, such as the purchase of a ticket or title of transport, prior registration or having a certain age.', 'In contrast a space should not be considered to be publicly accessible if access is limited to specific and defined natural persons through either Union or national law directly related to public safety or security or through the clear manifestation', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj', 'of will by the person having the relevant authority over the space.', 'The factual possibility of access alone, such as an unlocked door or an open gate in a fence, does not imply that the space is publicly accessible in the presence of indications or circumstances suggesting the contrary, such as.', 'signs prohibiting or restricting access.', 'Company and factory premises, as well as offices and workplaces that are intended to be accessed only by relevant employees and service providers, are spaces that are not publicly accessible.', 'Publicly accessible spaces should not include prisons or border control.', 'Some other spaces may comprise both publicly accessible and non publicly accessible spaces, such as the hallway of a private residential building necessary to access a doctor’s office or an airport.', 'Online spaces are not covered, as they are not physical spaces.', 'Whether a given space is accessible to the public should however be determined on a case bycase basis, having regard to the specificities of the individual situation at hand.', '(20 In order to obtain the greatest benefits from AI systems while protecting fundamental rights, health and safety and to enable democratic control, AI literacy should equip providers, deployers and affected persons with the necessary notions to make informed decisions regarding AI systems.', 'Those notions may vary with regard to the relevant context and can include understanding the correct application of technical elements during the AI system’s development phase, the measures to be applied during its use, the suitable ways in which to interpret the AI system’s output, and, in the case of affected persons, the knowledge necessary to understand how decisions taken with the assistance of AI will have an impact on them.', 'In the context of the application this Regulation, AI literacy should provide all relevant actors in the AI value chain with the insights required to ensure the appropriate compliance and its correct enforcement.', 'Furthermore, the wide implementation of AI literacy measures and the introduction of appropriate follow up actions could contribute to improving working conditions and ultimately sustain the consolidation, and innovation path of trustworthy AI in the Union.', 'The European Artificial Intelligence Board (the ‘Board’) should support the Commission, to promote AI literacy tools, public awareness and understanding of the benefits, risks, safeguards, rights and obligations in relation to the use of AI systems.', 'In cooperation with the relevant stakeholders, the Commission and the Member States should facilitate the drawing up of voluntary codes of conduct to advance AI literacy among persons dealing with the development, operation and use of AI.', '(21 In order to ensure a level playing field and an effective protection of rights and freedoms of individuals across the Union, the rules established by this Regulation should apply to providers of AI systems in a non discriminatory manner, irrespective of whether they are established within the Union or in a third country, and to deployers of AI systems established within the Union.', '(22 In light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this Regulation even when they are not placed on the market, put into service, or used in the Union.', 'This is the case, for example, where an operator established in the Union contracts certain services to an operator established in a third country in relation to an activity to be performed by an AI system that would qualify as high risk.', 'In those circumstances, the AI system used in a third country by the operator could process data lawfully collected in and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting operator in the Union the output of that AI system resulting from that processing without that AI system being placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union.', 'To prevent the circumvention of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the Union, this Regulation should also apply to providers and deployers of AI systems that are established in a third country, to the extent the output produced by those systems is intended to be used in the Union.', 'Nonetheless, to take into account existing arrangements and special needs for future cooperation with foreign partners with whom information and evidence is exchanged, this Regulation should not apply to public authorities of a third country and international organisations when acting in the framework of cooperation or international agreements concluded at Union or national level for law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the Union or the Member States, provided that the relevant third country or international organisation provides adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.', 'Where relevant, this may cover activities of entities entrusted by the third countries to carry out specific tasks in support of such law enforcement and judicial cooperation.', 'Such framework for cooperation or agreements have been established bilaterally between Member States and third countries or between the European Union, Europol and other Union agencies and third countries and international organisations.', 'The authorities competent for supervision of the law enforcement and judicial authorities under this Regulation should assess whether those frameworks for cooperation or international agreements include adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.', 'Recipient national', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj', 'authorities and Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies making use of such outputs in the Union remain accountable to ensure their use complies with Union law.', 'When those international agreements are revised or new ones are concluded in the future, the contracting parties should make utmost efforts to align those agreements with the requirements of this Regulation.', '(23 This Regulation should also apply to Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies when acting as a provider or deployer of an AI system.', '(24 If, and insofar as, AI systems are placed on the market, put into service, or used with or without modification of such systems for military, defence or national security purposes, those should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation regardless of which type of entity is carrying out those activities, such as whether it is a public or private entity.', 'As regards military and defence purposes, such exclusion is justified both by Article 4(2) TEU and by the specificities of the Member States’ and the common Union defence policy covered by Chapter 2 of Title V TEU that are subject to public international law, which is therefore the more appropriate legal framework for the regulation of AI systems in the context of the use of lethal force and other AI systems in the context of military and defence activities.', 'As regards national security purposes, the exclusion is justified both by the fact that national security remains the sole responsibility of Member States in accordance with Article 4(2) TEU and by the specific nature and operational needs of national security activities and specific national rules applicable to those activities.', 'Nonetheless if an AI system developed, placed on the market, put into service or used for military, defence or national security purposes is used outside those temporarily or permanently for other purposes, for example, civilian or humanitarian purposes, law enforcement or public security purposes, such a system would fall within the scope of this Regulation.', 'In that case, the entity using the AI system for other than military, defence or national security purposes should ensure the compliance of the AI system with this Regulation, unless the system is already compliant with this Regulation.', 'AI systems placed on the market or put into service for an excluded purpose, namely military, defence or national security, and one or more non excluded purposes, such as civilian purposes or law enforcement, fall within the scope of this Regulation and providers of those systems should ensure compliance with this Regulation.', 'In those cases, the fact that an AI system may fall within the scope of this Regulation should not affect the possibility of entities carrying out national security, defence and military activities, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those activities, to use AI systems for national security, military and defence purposes, the use of which is excluded from the scope of this Regulation.', 'An AI system placed on the market for civilian or law enforcement purposes which is used with or without modification for military, defence or national security purposes should not fall within the scope of this Regulation, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those activities.', '(25 This Regulation should support innovation, should respect freedom of science, and should not undermine research and development activity.', 'It is therefore necessary to exclude from its scope AI systems and models specifically developed and put into service for the sole purpose of scientific research and development.', 'Moreover, it is necessary to ensure that this Regulation does not otherwise affect scientific research and development activity on AI systems or models prior to being placed on the market or put into service.', 'As regards product oriented research, testing and development activity regarding AI systems or models, the provisions of this Regulation should also not apply prior to those systems and models being put into service or placed on the market.', 'That exclusion is without prejudice to the obligation to comply with this Regulation where an AI system falling into the scope of this Regulation is placed on the market or put into service as a result of such research and development activity and to the application of provisions on AI regulatory sandboxes and testing in real world conditions.', 'Furthermore, without prejudice to the exclusion of AI systems specifically developed and put into service for the sole purpose of scientific research and development, any other AI system that may be used for the conduct of any research and development activity should remain subject to the provisions of this Regulation.', 'In any event, any research and development activity should be carried out in accordance with recognised ethical and professional standards for scientific research and should be conducted in accordance with applicable Union law.', '(26 In order to introduce a proportionate and effective set of binding rules for AI systems, a clearly defined risk based approach should be followed.', 'That approach should tailor the type and content of such rules to the intensity and scope of the risks that AI systems can generate.', 'It is therefore necessary to prohibit certain unacceptable AI practices to lay down requirements for high risk AI systems and obligations for the relevant operators, and to lay down transparency obligations for certain AI systems.', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj', '(27 While the risk based approach is the basis for a proportionate and effective set of binding rules, it is important to recall the 2019 Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI developed by the independent AI HLEG appointed by the Commission.', 'In those guidelines, the AI HLEG developed seven non binding ethical principles for AI which are intended to help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound.', 'The seven principles include human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental well being and accountability.', 'Without prejudice to the legally binding requirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, those guidelines contribute to the design of coherent, trustworthy and human centric AI, in line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is founded.', 'According to the guidelines of the AI HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are developed and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal autonomy, and that is functioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and overseen by humans.', 'Technical robustness and safety means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows robustness in the case of problems and resilience against attempts to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and minimise unintended harm.', 'Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in accordance with privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of quality and integrity.', 'Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows appropriate traceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they communicate or interact with an AI system, as well as duly informing deployers of the capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their rights.', 'Diversity, non discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that includes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality and cultural diversity, while avoiding discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law.', 'Social and environmental well being means that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as well as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long term impacts on the individual, society and democracy.', 'The application of those principles should be translated, when possible, in the design and use of AI models.', 'They should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this Regulation.', 'All stakeholders, including industry, academia, civil society and standardisation organisations, are encouraged to take into account, as appropriate, the ethical principles for the development of voluntary best practices and standards.', '(28 Aside from the many beneficial uses of AI, it can also be misused and provide novel and powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative and social control practices.', 'Such practices are particularly harmful and abusive and should be prohibited because they contradict Union values of respect for human dignity, freedom, equality democracy and the rule of law and fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including the right to non discrimination, to data protection and to privacy and the rights of the child.', '(29 AI enabled manipulative techniques can be used to persuade persons to engage in unwanted behaviours, or to deceive them by nudging them into decisions in a way that subverts and impairs their autonomy, decision making and free choices.', 'The placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of certain AI systems with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting human behaviour, whereby significant harms, in particular having sufficiently important adverse impacts on physical, psychological health or financial interests are likely to occur, are particularly dangerous and should therefore be prohibited.', 'Such AI systems deploy subliminal components such as audio, image, video stimuli that persons cannot perceive, as those stimuli are beyond human perception, or other manipulative or deceptive techniques that subvert or impair person’s autonomy, decision making or free choice in ways that people are not consciously aware of those techniques or, where they are aware of them, can still be deceived or are not able to control or resist them.', 'This could be facilitated, for example, by machine brain interfaces or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli are presented to persons, insofar as they may materially distort their behaviour in a significantly harmful manner.', 'In addition, AI systems may also otherwise exploit the vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16), or a specific social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities.', 'Such AI systems can be placed on the market, put into service or used with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause significant harm to that or another person or groups of persons, including harms that may be accumulated over time and should therefore be prohibited.', 'It may not be possible to assume that there is an', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj', '(16 Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on the accessibility requirements for products and services (OJ L 151, 7.6.2019, p.', 'intention to distort behaviour where the distortion results from factors external to the AI system which are outside the control of the provider or the deployer, namely factors that may not be reasonably foreseeable and therefore not possible for the provider or the deployer of the AI system to mitigate.', 'In any case, it is not necessary for the provider or the deployer to have the intention to cause significant harm, provided that such harm results from the manipulative or exploitative AI enabled practices.', 'The prohibitions for such AI practices are complementary to the provisions contained in Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (17), in particular unfair commercial practices leading to economic or financial harms to consumers are prohibited under all circumstances irrespective of whether they are put in place through AI systems or otherwise.', 'The prohibitions of manipulative and exploitative practices in this Regulation should not affect lawful practices in the context of medical treatment such as psychological treatment of a mental disease or physical rehabilitation, when those practices are carried out in accordance with the applicable law and medical standards, for example explicit consent of the individuals or their legal representatives.', 'In addition, common and legitimate commercial practices, for example in the field of advertising, that comply with the applicable law should not, in themselves, be regarded as constituting harmful manipulative AI enabled practices.', '(30 Biometric categorisation systems that are based on natural persons’ biometric data, such as an individual person’s face or fingerprint, to deduce or infer an individuals’ political opinions, trade union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, race, sex life or sexual orientation should be prohibited.', 'That prohibition should not cover the lawful labelling, filtering or categorisation of biometric data sets acquired in line with Union or national law according to biometric data, such as the sorting of images according to hair colour or eye colour, which can for example be used in the area of law enforcement.', '(31 AI systems providing social scoring of natural persons by public or private actors may lead to discriminatory outcomes and the exclusion of certain groups.', 'They may violate the right to dignity and non discrimination and the values of equality and justice.', 'Such AI systems evaluate or classify natural persons or groups thereof on the basis of multiple data points related to their social behaviour in multiple contexts or known, inferred or predicted personal or personality characteristics over certain periods of time.', 'The social score obtained from such AI systems may lead to the detrimental or unfavourable treatment of natural persons or whole groups thereof in social contexts, which are unrelated to the context in which the data was originally generated or collected or to a detrimental treatment that is disproportionate or unjustified to the gravity of their social behaviour.', 'AI systems entailing such unacceptable scoring practices and leading to such detrimental or unfavourable outcomes should therefore be prohibited.', 'That prohibition should not affect lawful evaluation practices of natural persons that are carried out for a specific purpose in accordance with Union and national law.', '(32 The use of AI systems for ‘real time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights.', 'Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects.', 'Such possible biased results and discriminatory effects are particularly relevant with regard to age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities.', 'In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems operating in real time carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned in the context of, or impacted by, law enforcement activities.', '(33 The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be prohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which outweighs the risks.', 'Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime including missing persons; certain threats to the life or to the physical safety of natural persons or of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or suspects of the criminal offences listed in an annex to this Regulation where those criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj', '(17 Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the

maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the law of that Member State.', 'Such a threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in accordance with national law contributes to ensuring that the offence should be serious enough to potentially justify the use of ‘real time’ remote biometric identification systems.', 'Moreover, the list of criminal offences provided in an annex to this Regulation is based on the 32 criminal offences listed in the Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA (18), taking into account that some of those offences are, in practice, likely to be more relevant than others, in that the recourse to ‘real time’ remote biometric identification could, foreseeably, be necessary and proportionate to highly varying degrees for the practical pursuit of the localisation or identification of a perpetrator or suspect of the different criminal offences listed and having regard to the likely differences in the seriousness, probability and scale of the harm or possible negative consequences.', 'An imminent threat to life or the physical safety of natural persons could also result from a serious disruption of critical infrastructure, as defined in Article 2, point (4) of Directive (EU) 2022/2557 of the European Parliament and of the Council (19), where the disruption or destruction of such critical infrastructure would result in an imminent threat to life or the physical safety of a person, including through serious harm to the provision of basic supplies to the population or to the exercise of the core function of the State.', 'In addition, this Regulation should preserve the ability for law enforcement, border control, immigration or asylum authorities to carry out identity checks in the presence of the person concerned in accordance with the conditions set out in Union and national law for such checks.', 'In particular, law enforcement, border control, immigration or asylum authorities should be able to use information systems, in accordance with Union or national law, to identify persons who, during an identity check, either refuse to be identified or are unable to state or prove their identity, without being required by this Regulation to obtain prior authorisation.', 'This could be, for example, a person involved in a crime, being unwilling or unable due to an accident or a medical condition, to disclose their identity to law enforcement authorities.', '(34 In order to ensure that those systems are used in a responsible and proportionate manner, it is also important to establish that, in each of those exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, certain elements should be taken into account, in particular as regards the nature of the situation giving rise to the request and the consequences of the use for the rights and freedoms of all persons concerned and the safeguards and conditions provided for with the use.', 'In addition, the use of ‘real time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be deployed only to confirm the specifically targeted individual’s identity and should be limited to what is strictly necessary concerning the period of time, as well as the geographic and personal scope, having regard in particular to the evidence or indications regarding the threats, the victims or perpetrator.', 'The use of the real time remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces should be authorised only if the relevant law enforcement authority has completed a fundamental rights impact assessment and, unless provided otherwise in this Regulation, has registered the system in the database as set out in this Regulation.', 'The reference database of persons should be appropriate for each use case in each of the situations mentioned above.', '(35 Each use of a ‘real time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of a Member State whose decision is binding.', 'Such authorisation should, in principle, be obtained prior to the use of the AI system with a view to identifying a person or persons.', 'Exceptions to that rule should be allowed in duly justified situations on grounds of urgency, namely in situations where the need to use the systems concerned is such as to make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before commencing the use of the AI system.', 'In such situations of urgency, the use of the AI system should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and should be subject to appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself.', 'In addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations request such authorisation while providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier, without undue delay and at the latest within 24 hours.', 'If such an authorisation is rejected, the use of real time biometric identification systems linked to that authorisation should cease with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be discarded and deleted.', 'Such data includes', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj', '(18 Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the

rules of national law.', 'Consequently, Member States remain free under this Regulation not to provide for such a possibility at all or to only provide for such a possibility in respect of some of the objectives capable of justifying authorised use identified in this Regulation.', 'Such national rules should be notified to the Commission within 30 days of their adoption.', '(38 The use of AI systems for real time remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the processing of biometric data.', 'The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive (EU 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in an exhaustive manner.', 'Therefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for

intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2016/680.', 'However, the use of real time remote biometric identification systems in publicly

routes.', '(43 The placing on the market, the putting into service for that specific purpose, or the use of AI systems that create or expand facial recognition databases through the untargeted

considerably across cultures and situations, and even within a single individual.', 'Among the key shortcomings of such systems are the limited reliability, the lack of specificity and the limited generalisability.', 'Therefore, AI systems identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data may lead to discriminatory outcomes and can be intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons.', 'Considering the imbalance of power in the context of work or education, combined with the intrusive nature of these systems, such

special category of personal data, it is appropriate to classify as high risk several critical use cases of biometric systems, insofar as their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law.', 'Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects.', 'The risk of such biased results and discriminatory effects is particularly relevant with regard to age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities.', 'Remote biometric identification systems should therefore be classified as high risk in view of the risks that they pose.', 'Such a classification excludes AI systems intended to be used for biometric verification, including authentication, the sole purpose of which is to confirm that a specific natural person is who that person claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or having secure access to premises.', 'In addition AI systems intended to be used for biometric categorisation according to sensitive attributes or characteristics protected under Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the basis of biometric data, in so far as these are not prohibited under this Regulation, and emotion recognition systems that are not prohibited under this Regulation should be classified as high risk.', 'Biometric systems which are intended to be used solely for the purpose of enabling cybersecurity and personal data protection measures should not be considered to be high risk AI systems.', '(55 As regards the management and operation of critical infrastructure, it is appropriate to classify as high risk the AI systems intended to be used as safety components in the management and operation of critical digital infrastructure as listed in point (8) of the Annex to Directive (EU) 2022/2557, road traffic and the supply of water, gas, heating and electricity, since their failure or malfunctioning may put at risk the life and health of persons at large scale and lead to appreciable disruptions in the ordinary conduct of social and economic activities.', 'Safety components of critical infrastructure, including critical digital infrastructure, are systems used to directly protect the physical integrity of critical infrastructure or the health and safety of persons and property but which are not necessary in order for the', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj', 'system to function.', 'The failure or malfunctioning of such components might directly lead to risks to the physical integrity of critical infrastructure and thus to risks to health and safety of persons and property.', 'Components intended to be used solely for cybersecurity purposes should not qualify as safety components.', 'Examples of safety components of such critical infrastructure may include systems for monitoring water pressure or fire alarm controlling systems in cloud computing centres.', '(56 The deployment of AI systems in education is important to promote high quality digital education and training and to allow all learners and teachers to acquire and share the necessary digital skills and competences, including media literacy, and critical thinking, to take an active part in the economy, society, and in democratic processes.', 'However AI systems used in education or vocational training, in particular for determining access or admission, for assigning persons to educational and vocational training institutions or programmes at all levels, for evaluating learning outcomes of persons, for assessing the appropriate level of education for an individual and materially influencing the level of education and training that individuals will receive or will be able to access or for monitoring and detecting prohibited behaviour of students during tests should be classified as high risk AI systems, since they may determine the educational and professional course of a person’s life and therefore may affect that person’s ability to secure a livelihood.', 'When improperly designed and used, such systems may be particularly intrusive and may violate the right to education and training as well as the right not to be discriminated against and perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, for example against women, certain age groups, persons with disabilities, or persons of certain racial or ethnic origins or sexual orientation.', '(57 AI systems used in employment, workers management and access to self employment, in particular for the recruitment and selection of persons, for making decisions affecting terms of the work related relationship promotion and termination of work related contractual relationships, for allocating tasks on the basis of individual behaviour, personal traits or characteristics and for monitoring or evaluation of persons in work related contractual relationships, should also be classified as high risk, since those systems may have an appreciable impact on future career prospects, livelihoods of those persons and workers’ rights.', 'Relevant work related contractual relationships should, in a meaningful manner, involve employees and persons providing services through platforms as referred to in the Commission Work Programme 2021.', 'Throughout the recruitment process and in the evaluation, promotion or retention of persons in work related contractual relationships, such systems may perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, for example against women, certain age groups, persons with disabilities, or persons of certain racial or ethnic origins or sexual orientation.', 'AI systems used to monitor the performance and behaviour of such persons may also undermine their fundamental rights to data protection and privacy.', '(58 Another area in which the use of AI systems deserves special consideration is the access to and enjoyment of certain essential private and public services and benefits necessary for people to fully participate in society or to improve one’s standard of living.', 'In particular, natural persons applying for or receiving essential public assistance benefits and services from public authorities namely healthcare services, social security benefits, social services providing protection in cases such as maternity, illness, industrial accidents, dependency or old age and loss of employment and social and housing assistance, are typically dependent on those benefits and services and in a vulnerable position in relation to the responsible authorities.', 'If AI systems are used for determining whether such benefits and services should be granted, denied, reduced, revoked or reclaimed by authorities, including whether beneficiaries are legitimately entitled to such benefits or services, those systems may have a significant impact on persons’ livelihood and may infringe their fundamental rights, such as the right to social protection, non discrimination, human dignity or an effective remedy and should therefore be classified as high risk.', 'Nonetheless, this Regulation should not hamper the development and use of innovative approaches in the public administration, which would stand to benefit from a wider use of compliant and safe AI systems, provided that those systems do not entail a high risk to legal and natural persons.', 'In addition, AI systems used to evaluate the credit score or creditworthiness of natural persons should be classified as high risk AI systems, since they determine those persons’ access to financial resources or essential services such as housing, electricity, and telecommunication services.', 'AI systems used for those purposes may lead to discrimination between persons or groups and may perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination such as that based on racial or ethnic origins, gender, disabilities, age or sexual orientation, or may create new forms of discriminatory impacts.', 'However, AI systems provided for by Union law for the purpose of detecting fraud in the offering of financial services and for prudential purposes to calculate credit institutions’ and insurance undertakings’ capital requirements should not be considered to be high risk under this Regulation.', 'Moreover, AI systems intended', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj', 'to be used for risk assessment and pricing in relation to natural persons for health and life insurance can also have a significant impact on persons’ livelihood and if not duly designed, developed and used, can infringe their fundamental rights and can lead to serious consequences for people’s life and health, including financial exclusion and discrimination.', 'Finally, AI systems used to evaluate and classify emergency calls by natural persons or to dispatch or establish priority in the dispatching of emergency first response services, including by police, firefighters and medical aid, as well as of emergency healthcare patient triage systems, should also be classified as high risk since they make decisions in very critical situations for the life and health of persons and their property.', '(59 Given their role and responsibility, actions by law enforcement authorities involving certain uses of AI systems are characterised by a significant degree of power imbalance and may lead to surveillance, arrest or deprivation of a natural person’s liberty as well as other adverse impacts on fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter.', 'In particular, if the AI system is not trained with high quality data, does not meet adequate requirements in terms of its performance, its accuracy or robustness, or is not properly designed and tested before being put on the market or otherwise put into service, it may single out people in a discriminatory or otherwise incorrect or unjust manner.', 'Furthermore, the exercise of important procedural fundamental rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial as well as the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, could be hampered, in particular where such AI systems are not sufficiently transparent, explainable and documented.', 'It is therefore appropriate to classify as high risk, insofar as their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law, a number of AI systems intended to be used in the law enforcement context where accuracy, reliability and transparency is particularly important to avoid adverse impacts, retain public trust and ensure accountability and effective redress.', 'In view of the nature of the activities and the risks relating thereto, those high risk AI systems should include in particular AI systems intended to be used by or on behalf of law enforcement authorities or by Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies in support of law enforcement authorities for assessing the risk of a natural person to become a victim of criminal offences, as polygraphs and similar tools, for the evaluation of the reliability of evidence in in the course of investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, and, insofar as not prohibited under this Regulation, for assessing the risk of a natural person offending or reoffending not solely on the basis of the profiling of natural persons or the assessment of personality traits and characteristics or the past criminal behaviour of natural persons or groups, for profiling in the course of detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences.', 'AI systems specifically intended to be used for administrative proceedings by tax and customs authorities as well as by financial intelligence units carrying out administrative tasks analysing information pursuant to Union anti money laundering law should not be classified as high risk AI systems used by law enforcement authorities for the purpose of prevention detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences.', 'The use of AI tools by law enforcement and other relevant authorities should not become a factor of inequality, or exclusion.', 'The impact of the use of AI tools on the defence rights of suspects should not be ignored, in particular the difficulty in obtaining meaningful information on the functioning of those systems and the resulting difficulty in challenging their results in court, in particular by natural persons under investigation.', '(60 AI systems used in migration, asylum and border control management affect persons who are often in particularly vulnerable position and who are dependent on the outcome of the actions of the competent public authorities.', 'The accuracy, non discriminatory nature and transparency of the AI systems used in those contexts are therefore particularly important to guarantee respect for the fundamental rights of the affected persons, in particular their rights to free movement, non discrimination, protection of private life and personal data, international protection and good administration.', 'It is therefore appropriate to classify as high risk, insofar as their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law, AI systems intended to be used by or on behalf of competent public authorities or by Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies charged with tasks in the fields of migration, asylum and border control management as polygraphs and similar tools, for assessing certain risks posed by natural persons entering the territory of a Member State or applying for visa or asylum, for assisting competent public authorities for the examination, including related assessment of the reliability of evidence, of applications for asylum, visa and residence permits and associated complaints with regard to the objective to establish the eligibility of the natural persons applying for a status, for the purpose of detecting, recognising or identifying natural persons in the context of migration, asylum and border control management, with the exception of verification of travel documents.', 'AI systems in the area of migration, asylum and border control management covered by this Regulation should comply with the relevant procedural requirements set by the Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj', 'of the Council (32), the Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (33), and other relevant Union law.', 'The use of AI systems in migration, asylum and border control management should, in no circumstances be used by Member States or Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies as a means to circumvent their international obligations under the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 as amended by the Protocol of 31 January 1967.', 'Nor should they be used to in any way infringe on the principle of non refoulement, or to deny safe and effective legal avenues into the territory of the Union, including the right to international protection.', '(61 Certain AI systems intended for the administration of justice and democratic processes should be classified as high risk, considering their potentially significant impact on democracy, the rule of law, individual freedoms as well as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial.', 'In particular, to address the risks of potential biases, errors and opacity, it is appropriate to qualify as high risk AI systems intended to be used by a judicial authority or on its behalf to assist judicial authorities in researching and interpreting facts and the law and in applying the law to a concrete set of facts.', 'AI systems intended to be used by alternative dispute resolution bodies for those purposes should also be considered to be high risk when the outcomes of the alternative dispute resolution proceedings produce legal effects for the parties.', 'The use of AI tools can support the decision making power of judges or judicial independence, but should not replace it: the final decision making must remain a human driven activity.', 'The classification of AI systems as high risk should not, however, extend to AI systems intended for purely ancillary administrative activities that do not affect the actual administration of justice in individual cases, such as anonymisation or pseudonymisation of judicial decisions, documents or data, communication between personnel, administrative tasks.', '(62 Without prejudice to the rules provided for in Regulation (EU) 2024/900 of the European Parliament and of the Council (34), and in order to address the risks of undue external interference with the right to vote enshrined in Article 39 of the Charter, and of adverse effects on democracy and the rule of law, AI systems intended to be used to influence the outcome of an election or referendum or the voting behaviour of natural persons in the exercise of their vote in elections or referenda should be classified as high risk AI systems with the exception of AI systems whose output natural persons are not directly exposed to, such as tools used to organise, optimise and structure political campaigns from an administrative and logistical point of view.', '(63 The fact that an AI system is classified as a high risk AI system under this Regulation should not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the system is lawful under other acts of Union law or under national law compatible with Union law, such as on the protection of personal data, on the use of polygraphs and similar tools or other systems to detect the emotional state of natural persons.', 'Any such use should continue to occur solely in accordance with the applicable requirements resulting from the Charter and from the applicable acts of secondary Union law and national law.', 'This Regulation should not be understood as providing for the legal ground for processing of personal data, including special categories of personal data, where relevant, unless it is specifically otherwise provided for in this Regulation.', '(64 To mitigate the risks from high risk AI systems placed on the market or put into service and to ensure a high level of trustworthiness, certain mandatory requirements should apply to high risk AI systems, taking into account the intended purpose and the context of use of the AI system and according to the risk management system to be established by the provider.', 'The measures adopted by the providers to comply with the mandatory requirements of this Regulation should take into account the generally acknowledged state of the art on AI, be proportionate and effective to meet the objectives of this Regulation.', 'Based on the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in Commission notice ‘The “Blue Guide” on the implementation of EU product rules 2022’, the general rule is that more than one legal act of Union harmonisation legislation may be applicable to one product, since the making available or putting into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation legislation.', 'The hazards of AI systems covered by the requirements of this Regulation concern different aspects than the existing Union harmonisation legislation and therefore the requirements of this Regulation would complement the existing body of the Union harmonisation legislation.', 'For example, machinery or medical devices products incorporating an AI system might present risks not addressed by the essential health and safety', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj', '(32 Regulation (EC) No

which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation based on the New Legislative Framework and listed in an annex to this Regulation apply should have flexibility with regard to operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more AI systems with all the applicable requirements of that Union harmonised legislation in an optimal manner.', 'That flexibility could mean, for example a decision by the provider to integrate a part of the necessary testing and reporting processes, information and documentation required under this Regulation into already existing documentation and procedures required under existing Union harmonisation legislation based on the New Legislative Framework and listed in an annex to this Regulation.', 'This should not, in any way, undermine the obligation of the provider to comply with all the applicable requirements.', '(65 The risk management system should consist of a continuous, iterative process that is planned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high risk AI system.', 'That process should be aimed at identifying and mitigating the relevant risks of AI systems on health, safety and fundamental rights.', 'The risk management system should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure its continuing effectiveness, as well as justification and documentation of any significant decisions and actions taken subject to this Regulation.', 'This process should ensure that the provider identifies risks or adverse impacts and implements mitigation measures for the known

from the interaction between the AI system and the environment within which it operates.', 'The risk management system should adopt the most appropriate risk management measures in light of the state of the art in AI.', 'When identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the provider should document and explain the choices made and, when relevant involve experts and external stakeholders.', 'In identifying the reasonably foreseeable misuse of high risk AI systems the provider should cover uses of AI systems which, while not directly covered by the intended purpose and provided for in the instruction for use may nevertheless be reasonably expected to result from readily predictable human behaviour in the context of the specific characteristics and use of a particular AI system.', 'Any known or foreseeable circumstances related to the use of the high risk AI system in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse, which may lead to risks to the health and safety or fundamental rights should be included in the instructions for use that are provided by the provider.', 'This is to ensure that the deployer is aware and takes them into account when using the high risk AI system.', 'Identifying and implementing risk mitigation measures for foreseeable misuse under this Regulation should not require specific additional training for the high risk AI system by the provider to address foreseeable misuse.', 'The providers however are encouraged to consider such additional training measures to mitigate reasonable foreseeable misuses as necessary and appropriate.', '(66 Requirements should apply to high risk AI systems as regards risk management, the quality and relevance of data sets used, technical documentation and record keeping, transparency and the provision of information to deployers human oversight, and robustness, accuracy and cybersecurity.', 'Those requirements are necessary to effectively mitigate the risks for health, safety and fundamental rights.', 'As no other less trade restrictive measures are reasonably available those requirements are not unjustified restrictions to trade.', '(67 High quality data and access to high quality data plays a vital role in providing structure and in ensuring the performance of many AI systems, especially when techniques involving the training of models are used, with a view to ensure that the high risk AI system performs as intended and safely and it does not become a source of discrimination prohibited by Union law.', 'High quality data sets for training, validation and testing require the implementation of appropriate data governance and management practices.', 'Data sets for training, validation and testing, including the labels, should be relevant, sufficiently representative, and to the best extent possible free of errors and complete in view of the intended purpose of the system.', 'In order to facilitate compliance with Union data protection law, such as Regulation (EU) 2016/679, data governance and management practices should include, in the case of personal data, transparency about the original purpose of the data collection.', 'The data sets should also have the appropriate statistical properties, including as regards the persons or groups of persons in relation to whom the high risk AI system is intended to be used, with specific attention to the mitigation of possible biases in the data sets, that are likely to affect the health and safety of persons, have a negative impact on fundamental rights or lead to discrimination prohibited under Union law, especially where data outputs influence inputs for future operations', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj',

'Results provided by AI systems could be influenced by such inherent biases that are inclined to gradually increase and thereby perpetuate and amplify existing discrimination, in particular for persons belonging to certain vulnerable groups, including racial or ethnic groups.', 'The requirement for the data sets to be to the best extent possible complete and free of errors should not affect the use of privacy preserving techniques in the context of the development and testing of AI systems.', 'In particular, data sets should take into account, to the extent required by their intended purpose, the features, characteristics or elements that are particular to the specific geographical, contextual, behavioural or functional setting which the AI system is intended to be used.', 'The requirements related to data governance can be complied with by having recourse to third parties that offer certified compliance services including verification of data governance, data set integrity and data training, validation and testing practices, as far as compliance with the data requirements of this Regulation are ensured.', '(68 For the development and assessment of high risk AI systems, certain actors, such as providers, notified bodies and other relevant entities, such as European Digital Innovation Hubs, testing experimentation facilities and researchers should be able to access and use high quality data sets within the fields of activities of those actors which are related to this Regulation.', 'European common data spaces established by the Commission and the facilitation of data sharing between businesses and with government in the public interest will be instrumental to provide trustful, accountable and non discriminatory access to high quality data for the training, validation and testing of AI systems.', 'For example, in health, the European health data space will facilitate non discriminatory access to health data and the training of AI algorithms on those data sets, in a privacy preserving, secure, timely, transparent and trustworthy manner, and with an appropriate institutional governance.', 'Relevant competent authorities, including sectoral ones providing or supporting the access to data may also support the provision of high quality data for the training validation and testing of AI systems.', '(69 The right to privacy and to protection of personal data must be guaranteed throughout the entire lifecycle of the AI system.', 'In this regard, the principles of data minimisation and data protection by design and by default, as set out in Union data protection law, are applicable when personal data are processed.', 'Measures taken by providers to ensure compliance with those principles may include not only anonymisation and encryption, but also the use of technology that permits algorithms to be brought to the data and allows training of AI systems without the transmission between parties or copying of the raw or structured data themselves, without prejudice to the requirements on data governance provided for in this Regulation.', '(70 In order to protect the right of others from the discrimination that might result from the bias in AI systems, the providers should, exceptionally, to the extent that it is strictly necessary for the purpose of ensuring bias detection and correction in relation to the high risk AI systems, subject to appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and following the application of all applicable conditions laid down under this Regulation in addition to the conditions laid down in Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive (EU) 2016/680, be able to process also special categories of personal data, as a matter of substantial public interest within the meaning of Article 9(2), point (g) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 10(2), point (g) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.', '(71 Having comprehensible information on how high risk AI systems have been developed and how they perform throughout their lifetime is essential to enable traceability of those systems, verify compliance with the requirements under this Regulation, as well as monitoring of their operations and post market monitoring.', 'This requires keeping records and the availability of technical documentation, containing information which is necessary to assess the compliance of the AI system with the relevant requirements and facilitate post market monitoring.', 'Such information should include the general characteristics, capabilities and limitations of the system, algorithms, data, training testing and validation processes used as well as documentation on the relevant risk management system and drawn in a clear and comprehensive form.', 'The technical documentation should be kept up to date, appropriately throughout the lifetime of the AI system.', 'Furthermore, high risk AI systems should technically allow for the automatic recording of events, by means of logs, over the duration of the lifetime of the system.', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj', '(72 To address concerns related to opacity and complexity of certain AI systems and help deployers to fulfil their obligations under this Regulation, transparency should be required for high risk AI systems before they are placed on the market or put it into service.', 'High risk AI systems should be designed in a manner to enable deployers to understand how the AI system works, evaluate its functionality, and comprehend its strengths and limitations.', 'High risk AI systems should be accompanied by appropriate information in the form of instructions of use.', 'Such information should include the characteristics, capabilities and limitations of performance of the AI system.', 'Those would cover information on possible known and foreseeable circumstances related to the use of the high risk AI system, including deployer action that may influence system behaviour and performance, under which the AI system can lead to risks to health, safety, and fundamental rights, on the changes that have been pre determined and assessed for conformity by the provider and on the relevant human oversight measures, including the measures to facilitate the interpretation of the outputs of the AI system by the deployers.', 'Transparency, including the accompanying instructions for use, should assist deployers in the use of the system and support informed decision making by them.', 'Deployers should, inter alia, be in a better position to make the correct choice of the system that they intend to use in light of the obligations applicable to them, be educated about the intended and precluded uses and use the AI system correctly and as appropriate.', 'In order to enhance legibility and accessibility of the information included in the instructions of use, where appropriate, illustrative examples, for instance on the limitations and on the intended and precluded uses of the AI system, should be included.', 'Providers should ensure that all documentation, including the instructions for use, contains meaningful, comprehensive, accessible and understandable information, taking into account the needs and foreseeable knowledge of the target deployers.', 'Instructions for use should be made available in a language which can be easily understood by target deployers, as determined by the Member State concerned.', '(73 High risk AI systems should be designed and developed in such a way that natural persons can oversee their functioning, ensure that they are used as intended and that their impacts are addressed over the system’s lifecycle.', 'To that end, appropriate human oversight measures should be identified by the provider of the system before its placing on the market or putting into service.', 'In particular, where appropriate, such measures should guarantee that the system is subject to in built operational constraints that cannot be overridden by the system itself and is responsive to the human operator, and that the natural persons to whom human oversight has been assigned have the necessary competence, training and authority to carry out that role.', 'It is also essential, as appropriate, to ensure that high risk AI systems include mechanisms to guide and inform a natural person to whom human oversight has been assigned to make informed decisions if, when and how to intervene in order to avoid negative consequences or risks, or stop the system if it does not perform as intended.', 'Considering the significant consequences for persons in the case of an incorrect match by certain biometric identification systems, it is appropriate to provide for an enhanced human oversight requirement for those systems so that no action or decision may be taken by the deployer on the basis of the identification resulting from the system unless this has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two natural persons.', 'Those persons could be from one or more entities and include the person operating or using the system.', 'This requirement should not pose unnecessary burden or delays and it could be sufficient that the separate verifications by the different persons are automatically recorded in the logs generated by the system.', 'Given the specificities of the areas of law enforcement, migration, border control and asylum, this requirement should not apply where Union or national law considers the application of that requirement to be disproportionate.', '(74 High risk AI systems should perform consistently throughout their lifecycle and meet an appropriate level of accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity, in light of their intended purpose and in accordance with the generally acknowledged state of the art.', 'The Commission and relevant organisations and stakeholders are encouraged to take due consideration of the mitigation of risks and the negative impacts of the AI system.', 'The expected level of performance metrics should be declared in the accompanying instructions of use.', 'Providers are urged to communicate that information to deployers in a clear and easily understandable way, free of misunderstandings or misleading statements.', 'Union law on legal metrology, including Directives 2014/31/EU (35) and 2014/32/EU (36) of the European Parliament and of the Council, aims to ensure the accuracy of measurements and to help the transparency and fairness of commercial transactions.', 'In that context, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders and organisation, such as metrology and benchmarking authorities, the Commission should encourage, as appropriate the development of benchmarks and measurement methodologies for AI systems.', 'In doing so, the Commission should take note and collaborate with international partners working on metrology and relevant measurement indicators relating to AI.', 'ELI:

risk AI systems.', 'They should be resilient in relation to harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour that may result from limitations within the systems or the environment in which the systems operate (e.g.', 'errors, faults, inconsistencies, unexpected situations).', 'Therefore, technical and organisational measures should be taken to ensure robustness of high risk AI systems, for example by designing and developing appropriate technical solutions to prevent or minimise harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour.', 'Those technical solution may include for instance mechanisms enabling the system to safely interrupt its operation (fail safe plans) in the presence of certain anomalies or when operation takes place outside certain predetermined boundaries.', 'Failure to protect against these risks could lead to safety impacts or negatively affect the fundamental rights, for example due to erroneous decisions or wrong or biased outputs generated by the AI system.', '(76 Cybersecurity plays a crucial role in ensuring that AI systems are resilient against attempts to alter their use behaviour, performance or compromise their security properties by malicious third parties exploiting the system’s vulnerabilities.', 'Cyberattacks against AI systems can leverage AI specific assets, such as training data sets (e.g.', 'data poisoning) or trained models (e.g.', 'adversarial attacks or membership inference), or exploit vulnerabilities in the AI system’s digital assets or the underlying ICT infrastructure.', 'To ensure a level of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks suitable measures, such as security controls, should therefore be taken by the providers of high risk AI systems, also taking into account as appropriate the underlying ICT infrastructure.', '(77 Without prejudice to the requirements related to robustness and accuracy set out in this Regulation, high risk AI systems which fall within the scope of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on horizontal cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements, in accordance with that regulation may demonstrate compliance with the cybersecurity requirements of this Regulation by fulfilling the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in that regulation.', 'When high risk AI systems fulfil the essential requirements of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on horizontal cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements, they should be deemed compliant with the cybersecurity requirements set out in this Regulation in so far as the achievement of those requirements is demonstrated in the EU declaration of conformity or parts thereof issued under that regulation.', 'To that end, the assessment of the cybersecurity risks, associated to a product with digital elements classified as high risk AI system according to this Regulation, carried out under a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on horizontal cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements, should consider risks to the cyber resilience of an AI system as regards attempts by unauthorised third parties to alter its use, behaviour or performance, including AI specific vulnerabilities such as data poisoning or adversarial attacks, as well as, as relevant, risks to fundamental rights as required by this Regulation.', '(78 The conformity assessment procedure provided by this Regulation should apply in relation to the essential cybersecurity requirements of a product with digital elements covered by a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on horizontal cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements and classified as a high risk AI system under this Regulation.', 'However, this rule should not result in reducing the necessary level of assurance for critical products with digital elements covered by a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on

privacy for persons with disabilities.', 'Given the growing importance and use of AI systems, the application of universal design principles to all new technologies and services should ensure full and equal access for everyone potentially affected by or using AI technologies, including persons with disabilities, in a way that takes full account of their inherent dignity and diversity.', 'It is therefore essential that providers ensure full compliance with accessibility requirements, including Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of the Council (38) and Directive (EU)

system.', '(81 The provider should establish a sound quality management system, ensure the accomplishment of the required conformity assessment procedure, draw up the relevant documentation and establish a robust post market monitoring system.', 'Providers of high risk AI systems that are subject to obligations regarding quality management systems under relevant sectoral Union law should have the possibility to include the elements of the quality management system provided for in this Regulation as part of the existing quality management system provided for in that other sectoral Union law.', 'The complementarity between this Regulation and existing sectoral Union law should also be taken into account in future standardisation activities or guidance adopted by the

system adopted at a national or regional level, as appropriate, taking into account the specificities of the sector and the competences and organisation of the public authority concerned.', '(82 To enable enforcement of this Regulation and create a level playing field for operators, and, taking into account the different forms of making available of digital products, it is important to ensure that, under all circumstances a person established in the Union can provide authorities with all the necessary information on the compliance of an AI system.', 'Therefore, prior to making their AI systems available in the Union, providers established in third countries should, by written mandate, appoint an authorised representative established in the Union.', 'This authorised representative plays a pivotal role in ensuring the compliance of the high risk AI systems placed on the market or put into service in the Union by those providers who are not established in the Union and in serving as their contact person established in the Union.', '(83 In light of the nature and complexity of the value chain for AI systems and in line with the New Legislative Framework, it is essential to ensure legal certainty and facilitate the compliance with this Regulation.', 'Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the role and the specific obligations of relevant operators along that value chain, such as importers and distributors who may contribute to the development of AI systems.', 'In certain situations those operators could act in more than one role at the same time and should therefore fulfil cumulatively all relevant obligations associated with those roles.', 'For example, an operator could act as a distributor and an importer at the same time.', '(84 To ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that, under certain specific conditions, any distributor, importer deployer or other third party should be considered to be a provider of a high risk AI system and therefore assume all the relevant obligations.', 'This would be the case if that party puts its name or trademark on a high risk AI system already placed on the market or put into service, without prejudice to contractual arrangements stipulating that the obligations are allocated otherwise.', 'This would also be the case if that party makes a substantial modification to a high risk AI system that has already been placed on the market or has already been put into service in a way that it remains a high risk AI system in accordance with this Regulation, or if it modifies the intended purpose of an

the planned deployment of high risk AI systems at the workplace where the conditions for those information or information and consultation obligations in other legal instruments are not fulfilled.', 'Moreover, such information right is ancillary and necessary to the objective of protecting fundamental rights that underlies this Regulation.', 'Therefore, an information requirement to that effect should be laid down in this Regulation, without affecting any existing rights of workers.', '(93 Whilst risks related to AI systems can result from the way such systems are designed, risks can as well stem from how such AI systems are used.', 'Deployers of high risk AI system therefore play a critical role in ensuring that fundamental rights are protected, complementing the obligations of the provider when developing the AI system.', 'Deployers are best placed to understand how the high risk AI system will be used concretely and can therefore identify potential significant risks that were not foreseen in the development phase, due to a more precise knowledge of the context of use, the persons or groups of persons likely to be affected, including vulnerable groups.', 'Deployers of high risk AI systems listed in an annex to this Regulation also play a critical role in informing natural persons and should, when they make decisions or assist in making decisions related to natural persons, where applicable, inform the natural persons that they are subject to the use of the high risk AI system.', 'This information should include the intended purpose and the type of decisions it makes.', 'The deployer should also inform the natural persons about their right to an explanation provided under this Regulation.', 'With regard to high risk AI systems used for law enforcement

to be used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and groups who are likely to be affected in the specific context of use.', 'The assessment should also include the identification of specific risks of harm likely to have an impact on the fundamental rights of those persons or groups.', 'While performing this assessment, the deployer should take into account information relevant to a proper assessment of the impact, including but not limited to the information given by the provider of the high risk AI system in the instructions for use.', 'In light of the risks identified, deployers should determine measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of those risks, including for example governance arrangements in that specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use cases.',

characteristics of a general purpose AI model, in particular the generality and the capability to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks.', 'These models are typically trained on large amounts of data, through various methods, such as self supervised unsupervised or reinforcement learning.', 'General purpose AI models may be placed on the market in various ways including through libraries, application programming interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy.', 'These models may be further modified or fine tuned into new models.', 'Although AI models are

systemic risks, which should apply also when these models are integrated or form part of an AI system.', 'It should be understood that the obligations for the providers of general purpose AI models should apply once the general purpose AI models are placed on the market.', 'When the provider of a general purpose AI model integrates an own model into its own AI system that is made available on the market or put into service, that model should be considered to be placed on the market and, therefore, the obligations in this Regulation for models should continue to apply in addition to those

to increase transparency on the data that is used in the pre training and training of general purpose AI models, including text and data protected by copyright law, it is adequate that providers of such models draw up and make publicly available a sufficiently detailed summary of the content used for training the general purpose AI model.', 'While taking into due account the need to protect trade secrets and confidential business information, this summary should be generally comprehensive in its scope instead of technically detailed to facilitate parties with legitimate interests,

models should be limited to that modification or fine tuning, for example by complementing the already existing technical documentation with information on the modifications, including new training

foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, public and economic security; the dissemination of illegal, false, or discriminatory content.', 'Systemic risks should be understood to increase with model capabilities and model reach, can arise along the entire lifecycle of the model, and are influenced by conditions of misuse, model reliability, model fairness and model security, the level of autonomy of', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj', 'the model, its access to tools, novel or combined modalities, release and distribution strategies, the potential to remove guardrails and other factors.', 'In particular, international approaches have so far identified the need to pay attention to risks from potential intentional misuse or unintended issues of control relating to alignment with human intent; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, such as the ways in which barriers to entry can be lowered, including for weapons development, design acquisition, or use; offensive cyber capabilities, such as the ways in vulnerability discovery, exploitation, or operational use can be enabled; the effects of interaction and tool use, including for example the capacity to control physical systems and interfere with critical infrastructure; risks from models of making copies of themselves or ‘self replicating’ or training other models; the ways in which models can give rise to harmful bias and discrimination with risks to individuals, communities or societies; the facilitation of disinformation or harming privacy with threats to democratic values and human rights; risk that a particular event could lead to a chain reaction with considerable negative effects that could affect up to an entire city, an entire domain activity or an entire community.', '(111 It is appropriate to establish a methodology for the classification of general purpose AI models as general purpose AI model with systemic risks.', 'Since systemic risks result from particularly high capabilities, a general purpose AI model should be considered to present systemic risks if it has high impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal market due to its reach.', 'High impact capabilities in general purpose AI models means capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general purpose AI models.', 'The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood after its placing on the market or when deployers interact with the model.', 'According to the state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative amount of computation used for the training of the general purpose AI model measured in floating point operations is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities.', 'The cumulative amount of computation used for training includes the computation used across the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the model prior to deployment, such as pre training, synthetic data generation and fine tuning.', 'Therefore, an initial threshold of floating point operations should be set, which, if met by a general purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a general purpose AI model with systemic risks.', 'This threshold should be adjusted over time to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and indicators for model capability.', 'To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil society and other experts.', 'Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the assessment of high impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its capabilities and associated systemic risk of general purpose AI models, and could take into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of users it may affect.', 'To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission to take individual decisions designating a general purpose AI model as a general purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or an impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold.', 'That decision should be taken on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria for the designation of a general purpose AI model with systemic risk set out in an annex to this Regulation, such as quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and output modalities, its level of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to.', 'Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general purpose AI model can still be considered to present systemic risks.', '(112 It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general purpose AI model with systemic risks.', 'A general purpose AI model that meets the applicable threshold for high impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general purpose AI models with systemic risk.', 'The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general purpose AI model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption.', 'This is especially relevant in relation to the threshold of floating point operations because training of general purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of compute resources and, therefore, providers of general purpose AI models are able to know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed.', 'In the context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of its specific characteristics, a general purpose AI model exceptionally does not present systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general purpose AI model with systemic risks.', 'That information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the placing on the market of general purpose AI models with systemic risks and the providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on.', 'That information is especially', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj', 'important with regard to general purpose AI models that are planned to be released as open source, given that, after the open source model release, necessary measures to ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to implement.', '(113 If the Commission becomes aware of the fact that a general purpose AI model meets the requirements to classify as a general purpose AI model with systemic risk, which previously had either not been known or of which the relevant provider has failed to notify the Commission, the Commission should be empowered to designate it so.', 'A system of qualified alerts should ensure that the AI Office is made aware by the scientific panel of general purpose AI models that should possibly be classified as general purpose AI models with systemic risk, in addition to the monitoring activities of the AI Office.', '(114 The providers of general purpose AI models presenting systemic risks should be subject, in addition to the obligations provided for providers of general purpose AI models, to obligations aimed at identifying and mitigating those risks and ensuring an adequate level of cybersecurity protection, regardless of whether it is provided as a standalone model or embedded in an AI system or a product.', 'To achieve those objectives, this Regulation should require providers to perform the necessary model evaluations, in particular prior to its first placing on the market including conducting and documenting adversarial testing of models, also, as appropriate, through internal or independent external testing.', 'In addition, providers of general purpose AI models with systemic risks should continuously assess and mitigate systemic risks, including for example by putting in place risk management policies such as accountability and governance processes, implementing post market monitoring, taking appropriate measures along the entire model’s lifecycle and cooperating with relevant actors along the AI value chain.', '(115 Providers of general purpose AI models with systemic risks should assess and mitigate possible systemic risks.', 'If despite efforts to identify and prevent risks related to a general purpose AI model that may present systemic risks the development or use of the model causes a serious incident, the general purpose AI model provider should without undue delay keep track of the incident and report any relevant information and possible corrective measures to the Commission and national competent authorities.', 'Furthermore, providers should ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection for the model and its physical infrastructure, if appropriate, along the entire model lifecycle.', 'Cybersecurity protection related to systemic risks associated with malicious use or attacks should duly consider accidental model leakage, unauthorised releases, circumvention of safety measures, and defence against cyberattacks unauthorised access or model theft.', 'That protection could be facilitated by securing model weights, algorithms servers, and data sets, such as through operational security measures for information security, specific cybersecurity policies, adequate technical and established solutions, and cyber and physical access controls, appropriate to the relevant circumstances and the risks involved.', '(116 The AI Office should encourage and facilitate the drawing up, review and adaptation of codes of practice, taking into account international approaches.', 'All providers of general purpose AI models could be invited to participate.', 'To ensure that the codes of practice reflect the state of the art and duly take into account a diverse set of perspectives the AI Office should collaborate with relevant national competent authorities, and could, where appropriate, consult with civil society organisations and other relevant stakeholders and experts, including the Scientific Panel, for the drawing up of such codes.', 'Codes of practice should cover obligations for providers of general purpose AI models and of general purpose AI models presenting systemic risks.', 'In addition, as regards systemic risks, codes of practice should help to establish a risk taxonomy of the type and nature of the systemic risks at Union level, including their sources.', 'Codes of practice should also be focused on specific risk assessment and mitigation measures.', '(117 The codes of practice should represent a central tool for the proper compliance with the obligations provided for under this Regulation for providers of general purpose AI models.', 'Providers should be able to rely on codes of practice to demonstrate compliance with the obligations.', 'By means of implementing acts, the Commission may decide to approve a code of practice and give it a general validity within the Union, or, alternatively, to provide common rules for the implementation of the relevant obligations, if, by the time this Regulation becomes applicable a code of practice cannot be finalised or is not deemed adequate by the AI Office.', 'Once a harmonised standard is', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj', 'published and assessed as suitable to cover the relevant obligations by the AI Office, compliance with a European harmonised standard should grant providers the presumption of conformity.', 'Providers of general purpose AI models should furthermore be able to demonstrate compliance using alternative adequate means, if codes of practice or harmonised standards are not available, or they choose not to rely on those.', '(118 This Regulation regulates AI systems and AI models by imposing certain requirements and obligations for relevant market actors that are placing them on the market, putting into service or use in the Union, thereby complementing obligations for providers of intermediary services that embed such systems or models into their services regulated by Regulation (EU) 2022/2065.', 'To the extent that such systems or models are embedded into designated very large online platforms or very large online search engines, they are subject to the risk management framework provided for in Regulation (EU) 2022/2065.', 'Consequently, the corresponding obligations of this Regulation should be presumed to be fulfilled, unless significant systemic risks not covered by Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 emerge and are identified in such models.', 'Within this framework, providers of very large online platforms and very large online search engines are obliged to assess potential systemic risks stemming from the design, functioning and use of their services, including how the design of algorithmic systems used in the service may contribute to such risks, as well as systemic risks stemming from potential misuses.', 'Those providers are also obliged to take appropriate mitigating measures in observance of fundamental rights.', '(119 Considering the quick pace of innovation and the technological evolution of digital services in scope of different instruments of Union law in particular having in mind the usage and the perception of their recipients, the AI systems subject to this Regulation may be provided as intermediary services or parts thereof within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, which should be interpreted in a technology neutral manner.', 'For example, AI systems may be used to provide online search engines, in particular, to the extent that an AI system such as an online chatbot performs searches of, in principle, all websites, then incorporates the results into its existing knowledge and uses the updated knowledge to generate a single output that combines different sources of information.', '(120 Furthermore, obligations placed on providers and deployers of certain AI systems in this Regulation to enable the detection and disclosure that the outputs of those systems are artificially generated or manipulated are particularly relevant to facilitate the effective implementation of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065.', 'This applies in particular as regards the obligations of providers of very large online platforms or very large online search engines to identify and mitigate systemic risks that may arise from the dissemination of content that has been artificially generated or manipulated, in particular risk of the actual or foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, civic discourse and electoral processes, including through disinformation.', '(121 Standardisation should play a key role to provide technical solutions to providers to ensure compliance with this Regulation, in line with the state of the art, to promote innovation as well as competitiveness and growth in the single market.', 'Compliance with harmonised standards as defined in Article 2, point (1)(c), of Regulation (EU No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (41), which are normally expected to reflect the state of the art, should be a means for providers to demonstrate conformity with the requirements of this Regulation.', 'A balanced representation of interests involving all relevant stakeholders in the development of standards, in particular SMEs, consumer organisations and environmental and social stakeholders in accordance with Articles 5 and 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 should therefore be encouraged.', 'In order to facilitate compliance, the standardisation requests should be issued by the Commission without undue delay.', 'When preparing the standardisation request, the Commission should consult the advisory forum and the Board in order to collect relevant expertise.', 'However, in the absence of relevant references to harmonised standards, the Commission should be able to establish, via implementing acts, and after consultation of the advisory forum, common specifications for certain requirements under this Regulation.', 'The common specification should be an exceptional fall back solution to facilitate the provider’s obligation to comply with the requirements of this Regulation, when the standardisation request has not been accepted by any of the European standardisation organisations, or when the relevant harmonised standards insufficiently address fundamental rights concerns, or when the harmonised standards do not comply with the request, or when there are delays in the adoption of an appropriate

existing Union harmonisation legislation based on the New Legislative Framework, the compliance of those AI systems with the requirements of this Regulation should be assessed as part of the conformity assessment already provided for in that law.', 'The applicability of the requirements of this Regulation should thus not affect the specific logic, methodology or general structure of conformity assessment under the relevant Union harmonisation legislation.', '(125 Given the complexity of high risk AI systems and the risks that are associated with them, it is important to develop an adequate conformity assessment procedure for high risk AI systems involving notified bodies, so called third party conformity assessment.', 'However, given the current experience of professional pre market certifiers in the field of product safety and the different nature of risks involved, it is appropriate to limit, at least in an initial phase of application of this Regulation, the scope of application of third party conformity assessment for high risk AI systems other than those related to products.', 'Therefore, the conformity assessment of such systems should be carried out as a general rule by the provider under its own responsibility, with the only exception of AI systems intended to be used for biometrics.', '(126 In order to carry out third party conformity assessments when so required, notified bodies should be notified under this Regulation by the national competent authorities, provided that they comply with a set of requirements, in particular on independence, competence, absence of conflicts of interests and suitable cybersecurity requirements.', 'Notification of those bodies should be sent by national competent authorities to the Commission and the other Member States by means of the electronic notification tool developed and managed by the Commission pursuant to Article R23 of Annex I to Decision No 768/2008/EC.', '(127 In line with Union commitments

assessment bodies, independent of the territory in which they are established, provided that those conformity assessment bodies established under the law of a third country meet the applicable requirements of this Regulation and the Union has concluded an agreement to that extent.', 'In this context, the Commission should actively explore possible international instruments for that purpose and in particular pursue the conclusion of mutual recognition agreements with third countries.', '(128 In line with the commonly established notion of substantial modification for products regulated by Union harmonisation legislation, it is appropriate that whenever a change occurs which may affect the compliance of a high risk AI system with this Regulation (e.g.', 'change of operating system or

changes occurring to the algorithm and the performance of AI systems which continue to ‘learn’ after being placed on the market or put into service, namely automatically adapting how functions are carried out, should not constitute a substantial modification, provided that those changes have been pre determined by the provider and assessed at the moment of the conformity assessment.', 'ELI:

AI systems other than those related to products falling within the scope of relevant existing Union harmonisation legislation, as well as providers who consider that an AI system listed in the high risk use cases in an annex to this Regulation is not high risk on the basis of a derogation, should be required to register themselves and information about their AI system in an EU database, to be

content logging methods, fingerprints or other techniques, as may be appropriate.', 'When implementing this obligation providers should also take into account the specificities and the limitations of the different types of content and the relevant technological and market developments in the field, as reflected in the generally acknowledged state of the art.', 'Such techniques and methods can be implemented at the level of the AI system or at the level of the AI model including general purpose AI models generating content, thereby facilitating fulfilment of this obligation by the downstream provider of the AI system.', 'To remain proportionate, it is appropriate to envisage that this marking obligation should not cover AI systems performing primarily an assistive function for standard editing or AI systems not substantially altering the input data provided by the deployer or the semantics thereof.', '(134 Further to the technical solutions employed by the providers of the AI system, deployers who use an AI system to generate or manipulate image, audio or video content that appreciably resembles existing persons, objects, places entities or events and would falsely appear to a person to be authentic or truthful (deep fakes), should also clearly and distinguishably disclose that the content has been artificially created or manipulated by labelling the AI output accordingly and disclosing its artificial origin.', 'Compliance with this transparency obligation should not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the AI system or its output impedes the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom of the arts and sciences guaranteed in the Charter, in particular where the content is part of an evidently creative, satirical, artistic, fictional or analogous work or programme, subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of third parties.', 'In those cases, the transparency obligation for deep fakes set out in this Regulation is limited to disclosure of the existence of such generated or manipulated content in an appropriate manner that does not hamper the display or enjoyment of the work, including its normal exploitation and use, while maintaining the utility and quality of the work.', 'In addition, it is also appropriate to envisage a similar disclosure obligation in relation to AI generated or manipulated text to the extent it is published with the purpose of informing the public on matters of public interest unless the AI generated content has undergone a process of human review or editorial control and a natural or legal person holds editorial responsibility for the publication of the content.', '(135 Without prejudice to the mandatory nature and full applicability of the transparency obligations, the Commission may also encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at Union level to facilitate the effective implementation of the obligations regarding the detection and labelling of artificially generated or manipulated content, including to support practical arrangements for making, as appropriate, the detection mechanisms accessible and facilitating cooperation with other actors along the value chain, disseminating content or checking its authenticity and provenance to enable the public to effectively distinguish AI generated content.', '(136 The obligations placed on providers and deployers of certain AI systems in this Regulation to enable the detection and disclosure that the outputs of those systems are artificially generated or manipulated are particularly relevant to facilitate the effective implementation of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065.', 'This applies in particular as regards the obligations of providers of very large online platforms or very large online search engines to identify and mitigate systemic risks that may arise from the dissemination of content that has been artificially generated or manipulated in particular the risk of the actual or foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, civic discourse and electoral processes, including through disinformation.', 'The requirement to label content generated by AI systems under this Regulation is without prejudice to the obligation in Article 16(6) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 for providers of hosting services to process notices on illegal content received pursuant to Article 16(1) of that Regulation and should not influence the assessment and the decision on the illegality of the specific content.', 'That assessment should be performed solely with reference to the rules governing the legality of the content.', 'ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj', '(137 Compliance with the transparency obligations for the AI systems covered by this Regulation should not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the AI system or its output is lawful under this Regulation or other Union and Member State law and should be without prejudice to other transparency obligations for deployers of AI systems laid down in Union or national law.', '(138 AI is a rapidly developing family of technologies that requires regulatory oversight and a safe and controlled space for experimentation, while ensuring responsible innovation and integration of appropriate safeguards and risk mitigation measures.', 'To ensure a legal framework that promotes innovation, is future proof and resilient to disruption, Member States should ensure that their national competent authorities establish at least one AI regulatory sandbox at national level to facilitate the development and testing of innovative AI systems under strict regulatory oversight before these systems are placed on the market or otherwise put into service.', 'Member States could also fulfil this obligation through participating in already existing regulatory sandboxes or establishing jointly a sandbox with one or more Member States’ competent authorities, insofar as this participation provides equivalent level of national coverage for the participating Member States.', 'AI regulatory sandboxes could be established in physical, digital or hybrid form and may accommodate physical as well as digital products.', 'Establishing authorities should also ensure that the AI regulatory sandboxes have the adequate resources for their functioning, including financial and human resources.', '(139 The objectives of the AI regulatory sandboxes should be to foster AI innovation by establishing a controlled experimentation and testing environment in the development and pre marketing phase with a view to ensuring compliance of the innovative AI systems with this Regulation and other relevant Union and national law.', 'Moreover the AI regulatory sandboxes should aim to enhance legal certainty for innovators and the competent authorities’ oversight and understanding of the opportunities, emerging risks and the impacts of AI use, to facilitate regulatory learning for authorities and undertakings, including with a view to future adaptions of the legal framework, to support cooperation and the sharing of best practices with the authorities involved in the AI regulatory sandbox and to accelerate access to markets, including by removing barriers for SMEs, including start ups.', 'AI regulatory sandboxes should be widely available throughout the Union, and particular attention should be given to their accessibility for SMEs, including start ups.', 'The participation in the AI regulatory sandbox should focus on issues that raise legal uncertainty for providers and prospective providers to innovate, experiment with AI in the Union and contribute to evidence based regulatory learning.', 'The supervision of the AI systems in the AI regulatory sandbox should therefore cover their development, training, testing and validation before the systems are placed on the market or put into service, as well as the notion and occurrence of substantial modification that may require a new conformity assessment procedure.', 'Any significant risks identified during the development and testing of such AI systems should result in adequate mitigation and, failing that, in the suspension of the development and testing process.', 'Where appropriate, national competent authorities establishing AI regulatory sandboxes should cooperate with other relevant authorities, including those supervising the protection of fundamental rights, and could allow for the involvement of other actors within the AI ecosystem such as national or European standardisation organisations notified bodies, testing and experimentation facilities, research and experimentation labs, European Digital Innovation Hubs and relevant stakeholder and civil society organisations.', 'To ensure uniform implementation across the Union and economies of scale, it is appropriate to establish common rules for the AI regulatory sandboxes’ implementation and a framework for cooperation between the relevant authorities involved in the supervision of the sandboxes.', 'AI regulatory sandboxes established under this Regulation should be without prejudice to other law allowing for the establishment of other sandboxes aiming to ensure compliance with law other than this Regulation.', 'Where appropriate, relevant competent authorities in charge of those other regulatory sandboxes should consider the benefits of using those sandboxes also for the purpose of ensuring compliance of AI systems with this Regulation.', 'Upon agreement between the national competent authorities and the participants in the AI regulatory sandbox, testing in real world conditions may also be operated and supervised in the framework of the AI regulatory sandbox.', '(140 This Regulation should provide the legal basis for the providers and prospective providers in the AI regulatory sandbox to use personal data collected for other purposes for developing certain AI systems in the public interest within the AI regulatory sandbox, only under specified conditions, in accordance with Article 6(4) and Article 9(2) point (g), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and Articles 5, 6 and 10 of

sandbox should ensure appropriate safeguards and cooperate with the competent authorities, including by following their guidance and acting expeditiously and in good faith to adequately mitigate any identified significant risks to safety, health, and fundamental rights that may arise during the development testing and experimentation in that sandbox.', '(141 In order to accelerate the process of development and the placing on the market of the high risk AI systems listed in an annex to this Regulation, it is important that providers or prospective providers of such systems may also benefit from a specific regime for testing those systems in real world conditions, without participating in an AI regulatory sandbox.', 'However, in such cases, taking into account the possible consequences of such testing on individuals, it should be ensured that appropriate and sufficient guarantees and conditions are introduced by this Regulation for providers or prospective providers.', 'Such guarantees should include, inter alia, requesting informed consent of natural persons to participate in testing in real world conditions, with the exception of law enforcement where the seeking of informed consent would prevent the AI system from being tested.', 'Consent of subjects to participate in such testing under this Regulation is distinct from, and without prejudice to, consent of data subjects for the processing of their personal data under the relevant data protection law.', 'It is also important to minimise the risks and enable oversight by competent authorities and therefore require prospective providers to have a real world testing plan submitted to competent market surveillance authority, register the testing in dedicated sections in the EU database subject to some limited exceptions, set limitations on the period for which the testing can be done and require additional safeguards for persons belonging to certain vulnerable groups, as well as a written agreement defining the roles and responsibilities of prospective providers and deployers and effective oversight by competent personnel involved in the real world testing.', 'Furthermore, it is appropriate to envisage additional safeguards to ensure that the predictions, recommendations or decisions of the AI system can be effectively reversed and disregarded and that personal data is protected and is deleted when the subjects have withdrawn their consent to participate in the testing without prejudice to their rights as data subjects under the Union data protection law.', 'As regards transfer of data, it is also appropriate to envisage that data collected and processed for the purpose of testing in real world conditions should be transferred to third countries only where appropriate and applicable safeguards under Union law are implemented, in particular in accordance with bases for transfer of personal data under Union law on data protection, while for non personal data appropriate safeguards are put in place in accordance with Union law, such as Regulations (EU) 2022/868 (42) and (EU) 2023/2854 (43) of the European Parliament and of the Council.', '(142 To ensure that AI leads to socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, Member States are encouraged to support and promote research and development of AI solutions in support of socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, such as AI based solutions to increase accessibility for persons with disabilities, tackle socio economic inequalities, or meet environmental targets, by allocating sufficient resources, including public and Union funding, and, where appropriate and provided that the eligibility and selection criteria are fulfilled considering in particular projects which pursue such objectives.', 'Such projects should be based on the principle of interdisciplinary cooperation between AI developers, experts on inequality and non discrimination, accessibility consumer, environmental, and digital rights, as well as academics.', '(143 In order to promote and protect innovation, it is important that the interests of SMEs, including start ups, that are providers or deployers of AI systems are taken into particular account.', 'To that end, Member States should develop initiatives, which are targeted at those operators, including on awareness raising and information communication.', 'Member States should provide SMEs, including start ups, that have a registered office or a branch in the Union, with priority access to the AI regulatory sandboxes provided that they fulfil the eligibility conditions and selection criteria and without precluding other providers and prospective providers to access the sandboxes provided the same conditions and criteria are fulfilled.', 'Member States should utilise existing channels and where appropriate, establish new dedicated channels for communication with SMEs, including start ups, deployers, other innovators and, as appropriate, local public authorities, to support SMEs throughout their development path by providing guidance and responding to queries about the implementation of this Regulation.', 'Where appropriate, these channels should work together to create synergies and ensure homogeneity in their guidance to SMEs, including start ups, and deployers.', 'Additionally, Member States should facilitate the participation of SMEs and

Member States to lower such costs.', 'For example, translation costs related to mandatory documentation and communication with authorities may constitute a significant cost for providers and other operators, in particular those of a smaller scale.', 'Member States should possibly ensure that one of the languages determined and accepted by them for relevant providers’ documentation and for communication with operators is one which is broadly understood by the largest possible number of cross border deployers.', 'In order to address the specific needs of SMEs, including start ups, the Commission should provide standardised templates for the areas covered by this Regulation, upon request of the Board.', 'Additionally, the Commission should complement Member States’ efforts by providing a single information platform with easy touse information with regards to this Regulation for all providers and deployers, by organising appropriate communication campaigns to raise awareness about the obligations arising from this Regulation, and by evaluating and promoting the convergence of best practices in public procurement procedures in relation to AI systems.', 'Medium sized enterprises which until recently qualified as small enterprises within the meaning of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (44 should have access to those support measures, as

requirements for high risk AI systems.', 'The Commission should develop guidelines to specify the elements of the quality management system to be fulfilled in this simplified manner by microenterprises.', '(147 It is appropriate that the Commission facilitates, to the extent possible, access to testing and experimentation facilities to bodies, groups or laboratories established or accredited pursuant to any relevant Union harmonisation legislation and which fulfil tasks in the context of conformity assessment of products or devices covered by that Union harmonisation
